Record & Run
============

Being a developer I often come across situation where I have to do same action in the browser 100 times for bug fixing.

I feel like having a macro, like in Excel, which can record our actions and then run them as it is.
That would save our time and energy.

For the very reason, I created this project which will record your actions and run it when you need.

It is very immature and will take some time to mature.

Basic example given in the repo works fine in chrome.

Only click events are handled now. Key board events will be handle in the upcoming releases.

Contributions are always welcome. Contact me if you are willing to contribute.

Thanks to [unique-selector](https://github.com/ericclemmons/unique-selector) for the wonderful piece of code which made my work easier.
